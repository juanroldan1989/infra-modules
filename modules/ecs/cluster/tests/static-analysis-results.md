# ECS Cluster Module - Static Analysis Results

This document contains the comprehensive static analysis results generated by the `static-analysis.sh` script for the ECS Cluster module.

## Overview

The static analysis suite performs multiple validation checks to ensure code quality, security compliance, and adherence to best practices:

ECS Cluster Module - Static Analysis
======================================

Checking prerequisites...

Running: Terraform Format Check
✓ PASSED: Terraform Format Check

Running: Terraform Init
Initializing modules...
Downloading git::https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-ecs.git?ref=e7647af6055b50b49007ec4d60fb49227bbfd449 for ecs...
- ecs in .terraform/modules/ecs
Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/aws from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/aws v6.25.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
✓ PASSED: Terraform Init

Running: Terraform Validate
Success! The configuration is valid.

✓ PASSED: Terraform Validate

Initializing TFLint...
All plugins are already installed
Running: TFLint Analysis
✓ PASSED: TFLint Analysis

Running: TFSec Security Scan

======================================================
tfsec is joining the Trivy family

tfsec will continue to remain available
for the time being, although our engineering
attention will be directed at Trivy going forward.
